These are some useful scripts for pre-processing or post-processing for OpenFOAM.
To use these scripts, put following two lines to your $HOME/.bashrc (suppose you put this folder at $HOME)
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/myfoam_scripts
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$FOAM_SCRIPTS

Then you can use these scripts by typing its script name in case folder.

1.Scripts introduction


    myfoam_remove_timefiles
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This script will move all time files in a case to a new created file named 'timeFilesToBeRemoved'. 
    After checking, you can manully remove the folder "timeFilesToBeRemoved"

    To use this scripts, simply type 'myfoam_remove_timefiles' in case folder.



    myfoam_write_blockMeshDict
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This script is used to write blockMeshDict when you need to deal with multiple blocks with nonuniform mesh.

    Users do not have to compute mesh gradient or consider how to align blocks and faces in blockMeshDict.

    It can automatically generate blockMeshDict in ./constant/polyMesh.
    A log file named write_blockMeshDict.log will be created in ./constant/polyMesh for users to check their input and the result.

    To use this script, following these steps:
        1.Copy this script to current case folder (namely where you have folders like constant and system).
        2.Edit this script with editor, according to the comments in it. 
        3.Run it by typing './myfoam_write_blockMeshDict' in current case folder. (Don't miss './') 



    myfoam_mesh_calculator
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This script is used to calculate parameters when you need to set up for nonuniform mesh.

    3 Modes are available.

        1.Users specify length of the edge, size of first cell and size of last cell.
          It will compute and output following parameters: 
          *ratio of size of last cell to first cell, delta_n/delta_1 
          *total number of cells along this edge

        2.Users specify length of the edge, size of first cell and number of cells along this edge.
          It will compute and output following parameters: 
          *ratio between two adjacent cells, r = delta_{i+1} / delta_{i}
          *ratio of size of last cell to first cell, delta_n/delta_1 
          *size of last cell

        3.Users specify length of the edge, size of last cell and number of cells along this edge.
          It will compute and output following parameters: 
          *ratio between two adjacent cells, r = delta_{i+1} / delta_{i}
          *ratio of size of last cell to first cell, delta_n/delta_1 
          *size of first cell

    To use this script, edit last part of this script with editor, according to the comments in it. 
    Then run it in any folder by typing "myfoam_mesh_calculator".
    Result will be output on monitor.
    


    myfoam_getSetsHistory_alpha1
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This script is used to get time history of wave height.
    It will read data from ./postProcessing/sets/timefiles/gauge_name_alpha1.csv and then
    generate a file named history_gauge_name_alph1.csv in ./postProcessing .
    The first column in that file is time, and the second is wave height.

    To use this script, use any editor to open it. then change 'filename' variable in that file
    to gauge_name_alpha1.csv according to what is actually in your ./postProcessing/sets/timefiles .
    Then run script by typing 'myfoam_getSetsHistory_alpha1' in current case folder.



    myfoam_getSetsHistory_alpha1
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This script is used to get time history of sampled velocity.
    It will read data from ./postProcessing/sets/timefiles/gauge_name_U.csv and then
    generate some files named history_gauge_name_U.csv in ./postProcessing/history .
    The first column in those files is time, the second is coordinates (based on direction
    of your sampled line), the third is Ux, the fourth Uy and the last is Uz.

    To use this script, use any editor to open it. then change 'filename' variable in that file
    to gauge_name_U.csv according to what is actually in your ./postProcessing/sets/timefiles .
    Then run script by typing 'myfoam_getSetsHistory_U' in current case folder.


    myfoam_getforcesHistory
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If your case was interupted during the running, you may get several forces.dat files 
    which you want to build a complete force data file from.
    This file is written to handle this.

    (It was originally written with python3.4 and I have not had time to convert it to 
    python2.7 yet, which is available on hyak.)
